# smsCenterProvider

This project functions as a bridge between SMS providers and clients. Each user can have multiple SMS providers, and when they want to send an SMS to an entered number,
their providers are available to be chosen. The complexity of this project is related to the wide range of dynamic fields that have to be passed to each SMS provider for successful SMS sending.
